"""Off-hours scan cache gate (defense-in-depth against UW/IB waste).

The regime scan scripts (cri_scan, vcg_scan, gex_scan, gamma_rotation_gap) are
also driven by autonomous server timers. If a timer fires while the market is
closed, the script would re-fetch UW/IB for a session whose data is already
final — burning quota for nothing. This gate lets a script short-circuit: when
the market is closed AND a usable cache exists for the most-recent expected
session, serve the cache and skip the fetch entirely.

The frontend (`lib/marketSession.ts`) and FastAPI staleness layer apply the same
rule; this is the script-side backstop so even a stray off-hours invocation
costs zero UW/IB quota. An explicit `force` (wired to a `--force` CLI flag)
bypasses the gate for the rare manual off-hours refresh.
